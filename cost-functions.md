# Cost Functions

Explore how we can evaluate performance of a neuron.

We can use a cost function to measure how far off we are from the expected value.

In terms of weight and bias:

* y = true value \(vector\)
* a = neuronâ€™s prediction
* b = bias
* w = weights
* x = input \(vector\)
* X = input \(matrix\)
* z = cost
* sig\(\)= activation\(\) aka neuron

---

\( weight \* x.value \) + bias = z

```
(w * x) + b = z
```

neuron\(z\) =prediction

```
sig(z) = a
```
